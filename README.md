## Description

The MageSteady CSP Backoffice module for Magento 2 allows you to manage and edit the Content Security Policies (CSP) directly from the admin panel, instead of modifying XML files.

This module is particularly useful for teams where non-developers manage tagging strategies through tools like Google Tag Manager or directly from the Design configuration in the Magento backoffice.

## Installation

1.  Require the module via Composer: `composer require magesteady/csp-backoffice`
2.  Enable/install the module: `bin/magento setup:upgrade`

## Usage

1. Navigate to the Magento admin panel.
2. Go to MageSteady > Security > Content Security Policy.
3. Add, edit, or remove CSP policies as needed. You can also import from existing XML rules.
4. Go to Stores > Configuration > MageSteady > CSP Backoffice.
5. Enable the module.
6. Flush the cache.
